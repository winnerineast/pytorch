The ``distributions`` package contains parameterizable probability distributions
and sampling functions.

Policy gradient methods can be implemented using the
:meth:`~torch.distributions.Distribution.log_prob` method, when the probability
density function is differentiable with respect to its parameters. A basic
method is the REINFORCE rule:

.. math::

    \Delta\theta  = \alpha r \frac{\partial\log p(a|\pi^\theta(s))}{\partial\theta}

where :math:`\theta` are the parameters, :math:`\alpha` is the learning rate,
:math:`r` is the reward and :math:`p(a|\pi^\theta(s))` is the probability of
taking action :math:`a` in state :math:`s` given policy :math:`\pi^\theta`.

In practice we would sample an action from the output of a network, apply this
action in an environment, and then use ``log_prob`` to construct an equivalent
loss function. Note that we use a negative because optimisers use gradient
descent, whilst the rule above assumes gradient ascent. With a categorical
policy, the code for implementing REINFORCE would be as follows::

    probs = policy_network(state)
    # NOTE: this is equivalent to what used to be called multinomial
    m = Categorical(probs)
    action = m.sample()
    next_state, reward = env.step(action)
    loss = -m.log_prob(action) * reward
    loss.backward()
